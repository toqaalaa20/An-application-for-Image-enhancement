# Image-enhancement

The goal of this project is to develop an image enhancement system using the U-Net architecture, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in tasks such as image segmentation and restoration. In this project, we will focus on how U-Net can be used to improve the clarity and detail of images, making them more visually appealing and informative.

The model is trained on MIT-Adobe FiveK Dataset
